Eyelearner is an interactive language-learning simulation designed to teach a custom linguistic system—the Eyean cipher—through situational logic, real-world narrative immersion, and sensory feedback.

Project Overview
This application features a 12-unit curriculum that guides users from basic identity greetings to total linguistic synchronization. Unlike standard translators, this lab uses grounded, real-life stories to help users understand context, pronunciation, and the visual structure of the Eyean West and East scripts.

Key Features:
12 Unique Units: Each with its own set of characters and thematic vocabulary.

Sequential Mastery: Lessons are locked until the previous challenge is mastered via XP accumulation.

Multi-Sensory Feedback: Integrated sound effects for correct/wrong answers and UI interactions.

Live Translator: Real-time conversion between English, Eyean scripts, and Phonetic profiles.

Theme Engine: Toggle between Dark, Light, and High-Contrast modes for better accessibility.

Narrative Stories: Intercepted transmissions featuring characters like Elias, Orion, and the High Judge.
