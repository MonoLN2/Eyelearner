Eyelearner

Eyelearner is an interactive language-learning simulation designed to teach a custom linguistic system—the Eyean cipher—through situational logic and real-world narrative immersion.

🌟 Project Overview

This application features a 12-unit curriculum that guides users from basic identity greetings to total linguistic synchronization. Unlike standard translators, this lab uses grounded, real-life stories to help users understand context, pronunciation, and the visual structure of the Eyean West and East scripts.

Key Features:

12 Unique Units: Each with its own set of characters and thematic vocabulary.

Sequential Mastery: Lessons are locked until the previous challenge is mastered.

Live Translator: Real-time conversion between English, Eyean scripts, and Phonetic profiles.

Narrative Stories: Grounded dialogues featuring characters like Elias, Orion, and the High Judge.
